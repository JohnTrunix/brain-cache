# Welcome to my Brain Cache!

Welcome to JohnTrunix's Brain Cache, my personal go-to hub for tech-savvy personal notes and insights.

On this page, I document my acquired knowledge and store it as a personal library. You'll find various theoretical aspects, code documentation, and even side projects when I have the time and energy to work on them. This page is constantly being expanded.
