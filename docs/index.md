# Welcome to my Brain Cache!

Welcome to JohnTrunix's Brain Cache, my personal go-to hub for tech-savvy personal notes and insights.

On this page, I document my acquired knowledge and store it as a personal library. You'll find various theoretical aspects, code documentation, and even side projects when I have the time and energy to work on them. This page is constantly being expanded.

!!! note "Note"

    This page is a work in progress. I'm constantly adding new content and updating old content if I find time for it. If you find any errors or have any suggestions, please let me know!

!!! warning "Disclaimer"

     This page is not meant to be a complete guide or reference for any of the topics I cover. It is simply a personal notebook for me to store my own notes and insights. I do not guarantee that the information on this page is correct or up-to-date but I will try to keep it as accurate as possible.

!!! info "Contributions and Sense of this page"

     If you're interested in contributing something, please let me know first so we can discuss it. I want to keep this site as my own personal notebook and not get too carried away with other people's ideas. :wink:
